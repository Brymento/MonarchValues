    <h2>What is MonarchValues?</h2>
        <p>MonarchValues is a political compass test, made in cooperation with the "Kingdom of Based", that combines its own original questions with the UI of <a href="https://8values.github.io/"></a>8values to calculate what type of Monarchist are you, or if you even are one. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be displayed on a political compass to reflect your monarchist values.<br /><br />
        * A few questions have been reworded as I feel some of them were poorly written.</br></br>
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>
    <h2>Why use this version?</h2>
    <p>Because there really weren't any other test where the main focus was monarchy, there were some that include it as an axis or a result, but none were really made with monarchism as its main focus, until now!</p>
    <h2>Your questions / results suck!</h2>
